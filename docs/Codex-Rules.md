# Codex Rules

## Scope
- Follow the locked product documents before adding features.
- Keep changes small and focused.

## Output expectations
- Always name exact file paths.
- Provide diffs or clear file contents for changes.
- Include a quick validation step when possible.

## Safety
- Do not add features beyond the locked scope.
- Avoid changing multiple modules in one step unless required.
