# Privacy and Data Policy

Robocam is privacy-first by default. This document describes data handling principles and product
controls that protect users and subjects.

## Core Principles
- Collect only what is required to deliver product features.
- Default to anonymous and temporary identifiers.
- Require explicit opt-in for any identity-matching features.
- Provide transparency and auditability for sensitive actions.

## Face Data Handling
- Face detection is included by default and generates anonymous temporary face IDs.
- No naming or identity matching is enabled by default.
- Facial recognition is an optional add-on and requires explicit opt-in.
- Recognition uses private, user-managed galleries only.
- Recognition actions are logged with audit trails and confidence thresholds.

## Video and Event Data
- Events are structured records tied to detections and rules.
- Short clips are stored for investigation and timeline playback.
- Retention is enforced by tier and can be extended via add-on.

## License Plate Data
- License plate recognition is an optional add-on.
- Plate watchlists are user-managed and scoped to their locations.
- Confidence scoring and error tolerance are applied to reduce false actions.

## Access Control and Security
- Role-based access for accounts and locations.
- Audit logs for sensitive actions and recognition usage.
- Data access limited to the owning customer by default.

## Data Ownership and Deletion
- Customers own their data and can request deletion.
- Deletion removes stored clips, metadata, and watchlists associated with the account.

## Compliance Stance
- Privacy-first defaults reduce regulatory exposure.
- Recognition features are consent-based and limited to a single customer location.
- No cross-site identity by default.
