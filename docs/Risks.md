# Risks and Mitigations

This document tracks top-level risks to product, engineering, and market execution.

## Product and Market Risks
- Risk: Overly broad scope delays launch.
  Mitigation: Three milestone plan with strict exclusions per milestone.
- Risk: Pricing or tiers misaligned with customer expectations.
  Mitigation: Locked pricing model and simple per-camera billing.
- Risk: Customers expect CCTV replacement rather than intelligence layer.
  Mitigation: Positioning as AI vision intelligence with clear value outcomes.

## Technical Risks
- Risk: Camera compatibility issues (RTSP variability).
  Mitigation: Start with a tested compatibility list and expand gradually.
- Risk: AI accuracy leads to false alerts.
  Mitigation: Confidence thresholds, smart alerting, and clear toggle controls.
- Risk: Scaling beyond 32 cameras in self-serve tier.
  Mitigation: Enforce segmentation and route to sales-assisted enterprise.

## Privacy and Legal Risks
- Risk: Facial recognition regulatory exposure.
  Mitigation: Opt-in only, private galleries, audit logs, and consent-first defaults.
- Risk: Data retention and deletion requests mishandled.
  Mitigation: Tier-based retention policies and documented deletion process.

## Operational Risks
- Risk: Alert fatigue reduces trust.
  Mitigation: Smart alerting thresholds and per-feature toggles.
- Risk: Billing errors or unclear entitlements.
  Mitigation: Per-camera entitlements and automated billing checks.
- Risk: Support load exceeds capacity for a solo founder.
  Mitigation: Prioritize AI customer support and clear in-app guidance.
